# OOP_CPP_Learning_Mini_Projects
My learning journey of C++ OOP concepts with mini projects

Welcome to the **OOP_CPP_Learning_Mini_Projects** repository!  
This repo contains a curated collection of C++ mini projects designed to help you learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in a clear and practical way.

## About This Repository
The goal of this repository is to provide hands-on experience with fundamental and advanced OOP concepts in C++. Each mini project focuses on a specific concept or feature such as classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more.

Whether you are a beginner or preparing for interviews, these projects will help you understand OOP principles and improve your coding skills.

## Repository Structure

The projects are organized into folders based on the OOP topics they cover:

- `01_ClassesAndObjects/` — Basic projects to understand classes and objects.
- `02_Constructors/` — Projects focusing on constructors and constructor overloading.
- `03_Inheritance/` — Examples demonstrating inheritance types and use.
- `04_Polymorphism/` — Projects illustrating compile-time and runtime polymorphism.
- `05_Encapsulation_Abstraction/` — Demonstrating data hiding and abstraction.
- `06_OperatorOverloading/` — Projects covering operator overloading.
- `07_StaticMembers/` — Understanding static data members and methods.
- `...` — More folders and projects will be added progressively.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranjana-sagar/OOP_CPP_Learning_Mini_Projects.git
Navigate to the project folder you want to run:

 OOP_CPP_Learning_Mini_Projects/01_ClassesAndObjects/
Compile the C++ source code using g++:

g++ project_name.cpp -o project_name
Run the executable:

./project_name
Follow any on-screen instructions.
