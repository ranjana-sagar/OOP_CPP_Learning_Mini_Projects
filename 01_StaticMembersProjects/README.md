#  Student Registration System in C++

This is a simple **C++ mini project** that demonstrates a **Student Registration System** using **classes**, **static data members**, and **basic object-oriented programming concepts**.

---

## Features

- Register multiple students using object instances.
- Automatically track the total number of registered students using a `static` variable.
- Store and display student details: Name, Roll Number, and Course.
- Demonstrates:
  - Class definition and object creation
  - Static data members and static member functions
  - Data encapsulation using `private` access modifiers

---

##  Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler like g++, MSVC, Turbo C++, etc.
