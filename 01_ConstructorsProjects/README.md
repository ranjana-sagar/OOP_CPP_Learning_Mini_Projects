# Constructor Mini Projects Collection

This folder contains multiple mini projects focusing on **constructors** in C++.

## What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special member function in a class that initializes objects. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created.

### Types of Constructors covered here:
- Default Constructor
- Parameterized Constructor
- Constructor Overloading (Multiple constructors with different parameters)
- Constructor Chaining (optional advanced topic)

## Projects Included:

1. **Student Class with Constructors**  
   - Default and parameterized constructors  
   - Constructor overloading example

2. *(Add other project names here as you add more)*

## How to Use:

- Each project is inside its own folder.
- Navigate into a project folder to find the specific code and its README file.
- Compile and run each project independently.

**Note:** This collection is intended to help understand and practice different concepts of constructors in C++.
