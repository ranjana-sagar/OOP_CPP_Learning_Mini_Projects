# Car Showroom Inventory System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation and management of multiple car objects using a C++ class. Each car object stores details such as model, color, speed, and price, and the program displays these details for multiple instances.

## Concepts Covered
- Class creation in C++
- Data members and member functions
- Creating multiple instances (objects) of a class
- Using member functions to access and display object data

## Class Details
- **Private members:**
  - `color` (string)
  - `model` (string)
  - `speed` (short int)
  - `price` (unsigned int)
- **Public members:**
  - `setter()` method to set car details
  - `displayDetails()` method to print car information

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
2. Run the executable.
3. The program creates 3 car objects with different attributes and displays their details.
